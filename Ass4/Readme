We have implemented the IR code generation for Java with the help of python. We have basic features of a language like taking input, giving output, For loop, while statement and if clause, ternary statement, Variable allocation, array handling etc. Our main code is present in file parser_test.py. ST2.py is our Synboltablefile and ThreeAddressCode.py is file for genrating three address code.

To run code :
1.) Go to folder.
2.) Run command 'make' from bash terminal.
3.) After that run command 'bin/parser <filename>'
4.) We have made some primary test files for checking in folder test.


Some of my conventions are :
1.) 'GOTO' for direct jump to label.
2.) 'COND_GOTO' for jump when statement is false.
3.) 'COND_GOTO_TR' for jump when statement is true.
4.) '+*=' Add the offset to add and then get the value from address.
5.) '=*' get the value from address
6.) 'FETCH' for directly fetching the address of an array
7.) 'F_CALL' for function call
